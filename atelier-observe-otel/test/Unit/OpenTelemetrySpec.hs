-- | The proof-of-API for "Atelier.Observe.OpenTelemetry": instrument small oblivious effectful
-- programs, discharge them through the 'exporting' consumer into an in-memory OpenTelemetry
-- provider, and assert on the spans that come out — their nesting, attributes, status, links, and
-- events. The in-memory provider is a hand-rolled 'SpanProcessor' that records each finished
-- 'ImmutableSpan' into an 'IORef' as it ends (synchronously, inside 'endSpan'), so no flush is
-- needed.
