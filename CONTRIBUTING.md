# Project Conventions

> These conventions are mostly useful for bigger tasks. Small fixes and minor changes don't need to follow this structure.

## Proposals

Proposals live under `<component>/proposals/` (e.g. `tricorder/proposals/`).

Each proposal is a folder named `NNN-short-title/` where `NNN` is a zero-padded
ascending integer. Lower numbers are older; higher numbers are newer. A template is
provided at `000-template/`.

### Files within a proposal

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Work package — high-level description, objectives, milestones, acceptance criteria |
| `design.md` | Design — problem statement, chosen approach, alternatives considered, trade-offs |
| `spec.md` | Spec — precise contracts, wire formats, type definitions; the reference during implementation |
| `research.md` | Research — time-boxed explorations and findings that informed the design |

Not every proposal needs all four files. A simple refactor may only need `README.md`.
Create the others when the work warrants it.

### Proposal index

Each `proposals/` directory has a `README.md` index listing all proposals with their
status. Keep it up to date when adding or completing proposals.

### Roadmap

`ROADMAP.md` is the entry point for understanding what is planned. Features link to
their proposal folder using `[WP-NNN](path/)`. Dependencies between proposals are
expressed as `_Depends on:_ WP-NNN`.
