-- * 'waitUntilDone' pops states until it finds one where @phase /= Building@.
-- * 'waitForNext' pops states until it finds a Done state with a different 'BuildId'.

-- | Production interpreter backed by a 'TVar', sharing its STM state with

--
-- Blocking operations use STM @retry@ rather than polling, so a transient
-- 'Done' state cannot be missed by a poll cycle landing on the surrounding
-- 'Building' phases. 'atomically' is interruptible, so async exceptions
-- (e.g. Ki's @ScopeClosing@) propagate during daemon shutdown.
