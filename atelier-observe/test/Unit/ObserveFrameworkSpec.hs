-- | Properties of the observation framework in "Atelier.Observe". Signals ride the region boundaries:
-- a 'Tap' has 'onEnter'\/'onLeave'\/'onError', and they fire into 'Entered'\/'Exited'\/'Failed'. The
-- taps are built with the 'watch'\/'leaving'\/'tracedBy' setters. One property pins the headline win —
-- input captured on entry survives an operation that throws, which then closes as 'Failed' carrying
-- its 'onError' signals. 'rollUp' is checked to roll the observation lane while leaving the inclusive
-- measurement lane.
