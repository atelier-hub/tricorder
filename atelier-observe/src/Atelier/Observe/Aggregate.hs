-- | The hierarchical-rollup harvest for "Atelier.Observe": a 'Region' trie of two-laned 'Report's, keyed
-- by trace identity into 'Traces', and the 'collecting' 'Consumer' that builds it from a 'Moment'
-- stream. This is /one/ way to summarize a run — the right one when the run is a tree of nested
-- regions and you want per-region, prefix, and whole-run rollups. A flat event log, an order-
-- sensitive causal check, or a streaming exporter wants none of it and stays on the core
-- combinators ('foldMoments'\/'eachMoment') alone.
--
-- It lives apart from the core precisely because it is a policy, not machinery: every definition
-- here is a pure function of the public 'Moment' stream — @'collecting' reduce = 'foldMoments'
-- ('collectMoment' reduce)@, and the trie types touch no discharge internals — so the core never
-- depends on it, and a domain pulls it in only when its runs are hierarchical.

-- | A region trie: each node holds a payload @a@ filed /exactly/ at it ('here') and its
-- 'children', keyed one region label deep. A region only passed through on the way to something
-- deeper survives as a spine node with @'here' = 'mempty'@. The recursive 'Monoid' merges 'here'
-- field-wise and unions 'children', recursing on collision — the same coalescing the old flat
-- map's monoid did, but comparing single labels rather than whole paths.
--
-- The payload is the last parameter, so the derived 'Functor', 'Foldable', and 'Traversable'
-- range over /every node's payload/ with the tree intact: 'fmap' projects a lane across all
-- regions, 'fold' rolls the whole tree up, 'foldMap'\/'toList' answer cross-cutting queries, and
-- 'traverse' runs an effect per node. A run's harvest is a @'Region' r ('Report' o s)@.

-- same way into their region's report, so they share one arm; only 'Measured' fills the other half.
-- The two lanes write-isolate by construction. @'observe' ('collecting' reduce) plan prog@ harvests
-- a run.
--
-- A single report is placed with 'singletonPath' — a spine of mempty ancestor nodes down to the
-- region that observed it — and the recursive 'Region' monoid coalesces the lot.
