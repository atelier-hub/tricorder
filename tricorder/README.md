# tricorder

`tricorder` empowers developers and LLM coding agents working with Haskell by surfacing the right information at each stage: build status, diagnostics, test results, and documentation.

Like `ghcid` and `ghciwatch`, it rebuilds continuously on every change and reports diagnostics — but it runs builds in a background daemon so multiple clients (an interactive TUI, a `tricorder status` CLI, a Claude Code skill) can query a single shared build state without triggering redundant rebuilds. It discovers components across multi-package `cabal.project` workspaces automatically and ships machine-readable (`--json`) output for agentic use.

See the [repository README](https://github.com/atelier-hub/tricorder#readme) for installation (Nix, Home Manager, NixOS), Claude Code plugin setup, configuration, and custom key bindings.

## Built on atelier

`tricorder` is built on the **atelier** toolkit, also developed in this repository:

- [`atelier-prelude`](https://github.com/atelier-hub/tricorder/tree/main/atelier-prelude) — relude-based prelude with Effectful conventions
- [`atelier-core`](https://github.com/atelier-hub/tricorder/tree/main/atelier-core) — foundational effects and utilities
- [`atelier-db`](https://github.com/atelier-hub/tricorder/tree/main/atelier-db) — relational database effect (Hasql/Rel8)
- [`atelier-testing`](https://github.com/atelier-hub/tricorder/tree/main/atelier-testing) — database-backed test utilities
