-- | Whether a file path corresponds to one of GHCi's targets.
--
-- @:show targets@ entries are either dotted module names (e.g.
-- @Tricorder.CLI.Main@) or file paths (e.g. @app/Main.hs@). GHCi uses the path
-- form when a module name is ambiguous across home units — i.e. every
-- executable/test 'Main'. We match both forms.
--
-- The path form matters because a /failed/ executable 'Main' drops out of
-- @:show modules@ but survives in @:show targets@ as its path. Without matching
-- it, fixing the executable would dispatch a no-op 'Add' instead of a 'Reload',
-- leaving the diagnostic stale.

-- compared on directory-segment boundaries (so @app/Main.hs@ matches
-- @./tricorder/app/Main.hs@ but @pp/Main.hs@ does not). Module-name targets
-- (no @.hs@ extension) are left to the module-name branch above.

-- | Decide what GHCi action a source-file change requires.
--

-- @"In file included from ..."@) are dropped here, before they can enter the
-- accumulation map where they would be impossible to evict.
--
-- Location-less diagnostics (see 'isLocationLess') are always kept: they carry
-- no path to test against a watch dir, but they represent genuine build-level
-- failures (e.g. a home-unit GHC plugin that can't load under
-- @--enable-multi-repl@) that must not be dropped, or the build would silently

-- | Keep a failed build from ever reading as clean after watch-dir filtering.
--
-- 'filterToWatchDirs' drops diagnostics outside the watched directories. If a
-- load failed but every error it produced lay outside those dirs (e.g. a
-- compile error in a sibling home unit not under @watchDirs@), filtering would
-- leave no diagnostics and the broken build would look green. Detecting that an
-- error was present /before/ filtering but none survived, we re-attach the
-- location-less synthetic failure (which filtering always keeps) so the failure
-- still surfaces.
--
-- Takes the pre-filter diagnostics and the post-filter diagnostics; returns the
-- post-filter list, with the synthetic failure appended only when needed.
