# Verification builds for the `canvas` flake template (templates/canvas).
#
# The template ships as a standalone flake whose app depends on *released*
# atelier packages from Hackage, so the template's own `nix flake check` never
# exercises the in-development atelier sources living in this repo. These two
# checks close that gap:
#
#   * canvas-hackage — build the template exactly as it ships (atelier-* from
#     Hackage). Proves the template is buildable/publishable as released.
#   * canvas-local   — build the canvas app against this repo's in-development
#     atelier sources, catching API or version-bound drift before a release
#     breaks the template.
#
# Both are wired into legacyChecks (see nix/outputs.nix) for the template's
# target GHC only, so the existing CI matrix builds them automatically.
