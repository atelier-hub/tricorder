## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial release: a relude-based custom prelude adapted for Effectful
  conventions, extracted from the atelier toolkit.
- Lifted system, environment, handle, terminal and file operations
  (`Relude.Lifted.*` and `Relude.File`) and console output (`Relude.Print`)
  are intentionally not re-exported; the corresponding `atelier-core` effects
  (e.g. `Atelier.Effects.Env`, `Atelier.Effects.File`, `Atelier.Effects.Console`)
  should be used instead.
