-- | Effect and smart constructors for watching file system paths.
--
-- == Overview
--
-- Build a list of 'Watch' values describing what to observe, then pass them
-- to 'watchFilePaths'. The effect registers the OS-level watchers needed to
-- cover the list (deduplication by path prefix) and fires the callback at most
-- once per raw filesystem event for a path.
--
-- == Examples
--
-- Watch a source directory for Haskell files, ignoring build artefacts:
--
-- @
-- watchFilePaths [dirExt "src" ".hs" \`excluding\` containing "dist-newstyle"] callback
-- @
--
-- Watch source and test directories together:
--
-- @
-- watchFilePaths (map (\`dirExt\` ".hs") ["src", "test"]) callback
-- @
--
-- Watch cabal-related files anywhere under a project root:
--
-- @
-- watchFilePaths [dirWhere projectRoot isCabalFile] callback
--   where
--     isCabalFile f = takeExtension f == ".cabal"
--                  || takeFileName f \`elem\` ["cabal.project", "package.yaml"]
-- @
--
-- Combine source and cabal watches with a single callback that dispatches on
-- the path, with automatic debouncing:
--
-- @
-- watchFilePathsDebounced (sourceWatches ++ cabalWatches) (markDirty . changeKindFor)
-- @
