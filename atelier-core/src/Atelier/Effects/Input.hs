-- | An effect for requesting a value from the environment on each call.
--
-- Unlike 'Effectful.Reader.Static.Reader', 'Input' makes no assumption that the
-- value is stable across the computation — each 'input' may observe a different
-- value. See the 'Input' type below for the full comparison.

-- | Request a value from the effect system.
--
-- This effect does not carry any
-- semantics as to how the value is created, whether it is cached, or whether
-- you get a different value for each call. It is similar to
-- 'Effectful.Reader.Static.Reader' in that it is about requesting a value, but
-- 'Reader' carries the implicit assumption that its value remains static for
-- the duration of the encapsulated computation, while 'Input' carries no such
-- assumption.
--
-- If the value you wish to request from the effect system will remain
-- unchanged for the duration of the computation, use 'Effectful.Reader.Static'
-- or 'Effectful.Reader.Local' instead.

-- | Provides the same value for every invocation of the 'input' operation.
-- This is equivalent to using 'Effectful.Reader.Static' or
-- 'Effectful.Reader.Local', but is available here for testing.
