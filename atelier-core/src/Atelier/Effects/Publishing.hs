-- | A typed publish/subscribe effect pair.
--
-- 'Pub' publishes events of a given type; 'Sub' subscribes and delivers each
-- published event to a listener. 'runPubSub' wires the two together over an
-- internal broadcast channel, propagating tracing context from publisher to
-- listener; 'runPubWriter' instead records published events to a 'Writer', for
-- tests.
--
-- Subscriptions are established asynchronously, so a listener you intend to
-- publish to should be started with 'forkListener' or 'forkListener_', which
-- block until the subscription is live and therefore cannot miss early events.

    -- | Subscribe, then run @onSubscribed@ once the subscription is established
    -- — after the internal channel has been duplicated and before any event is
    -- delivered — and thereafter deliver every published event to the listener,
    -- forever. The @onSubscribed@ hook lets a caller synchronize on "subscribed"
    -- so a concurrently-started publisher cannot race ahead of the subscription
    -- and have its events missed. Most callers want 'listen' (no hook); a caller
    -- that forks the listener and then publishes must wait on this hook first.

-- This is the safe way to start a listener you intend to publish to: a plain
-- @'fork_' . 'listen'@ followed by a 'publish' races the subscription (which
-- happens asynchronously in the forked thread) and, under scheduler pressure,
-- can drop early events and wedge the listener forever. 'forkListener' closes
-- that window by waiting on the subscribed hook before returning.
