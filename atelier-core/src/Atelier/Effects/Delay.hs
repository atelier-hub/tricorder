-- | An effect for delaying execution.
--
-- 'wait' suspends the current thread for a 'TimeUnit' duration; 'every' repeats
-- an action forever with a fixed gap between runs. 'runDelay' performs real
-- delays, while 'runDelayNoOp' skips them so time-based code runs instantly
-- under test.
--
-- @
-- -- pause within a workflow:
-- wait (250 :: Millisecond)
--
-- -- run a health check every 30 seconds, forever (the caller forks it):
-- fork_ $ every (30 :: Second) checkHealth
