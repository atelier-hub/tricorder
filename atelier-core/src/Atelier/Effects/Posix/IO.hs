--
-- GHC's 'System.IO.openFile' and 'System.IO.withFile' participate in an
-- advisory file-locking protocol built on @flock(2)@:
--
--   * Write\/append mode acquires an exclusive lock (@LOCK_EX@).
--   * Read mode acquires a shared lock (@LOCK_SH@).
--
-- Because these locks are advisory, processes that do not call @flock@ can
-- always read or write the file freely. GHC's own runtime, however, refuses
-- to open a file for reading while another GHC process holds an exclusive
-- lock on it — even if the underlying read would be perfectly safe - and
-- throws @resource busy (file is locked)@.
--
-- This is a problem when a long-lived daemon holds a file open in append mode
-- and a short-lived client process wants to read that file. Using 'readFdAll',
-- the client opens the file via @open(2)@ without ever calling @flock@,
-- matching the behaviour of standard Unix tools like @cat@ and @tail@.
