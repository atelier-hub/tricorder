-- | Debounce effect for coalescing rapid bursts of keyed events.
--
-- == Overview
--
-- 'debouncedWith' is the fundamental operation: it accumulates rapid successive
-- calls with the same key using a merge function, then fires the callback once
-- after the settle window with the merged result.
--
-- 'debounced' is a convenience wrapper for the common case where only timing
-- matters and the last-registered action should fire.
--
-- == Example
--
-- @
-- -- Coalesce rapid saves per file: only the last edit within a 200ms window
-- -- triggers a rebuild, keyed by path.
-- onEdit :: (Debounce FilePath :> es) => FilePath -> Eff es ()
-- onEdit path = debounced 200 path (rebuild path)
--
-- -- Or merge the burst instead of keeping just the last value. Here every
-- -- event seen within the window is combined (list append) before a single
-- -- rebuild fires with the full batch.
-- onChange :: (Debounce FilePath :> es) => FilePath -> FileEvent -> Eff es ()
-- onChange path event =
--     debouncedWith 200 (<>) path [event] (rebuildWith path)
