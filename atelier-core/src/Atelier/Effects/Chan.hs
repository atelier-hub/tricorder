-- | A typed, unbounded channel effect backed by @unagi-chan@.
--
-- Exposes the split in\/out ends of a fast concurrent queue as an effect, plus a
-- batched read ('readChanBatched') for draining several items at once. The
-- 'InChan' and 'OutChan' types are re-exported so callers need not depend on
-- @unagi-chan@ directly.
--
-- @
-- -- write a few items (writeChan never blocks), then drain them in one batch:
-- pipeline :: (Chan :> es, Timeout :> es) => Eff es (NonEmpty Int)
-- pipeline = do
--     (inn, out) <- newChan
--     traverse_ (writeChan inn) [1 .. 10]
--     readChanBatched (50 :: Millisecond) 100 out   -- one blocking read, up to 100 items
--
-- -- dupChan gives a second, independent read end that sees later writes:
-- broadcast :: (Chan :> es) => Eff es (Int, Int)
-- broadcast = do
--     (inn, out1) <- newChan
--     out2 <- dupChan inn
--     writeChan inn 7
--     (,) <$> readChan out1 <*> readChan out2       -- (7, 7)
