-- to continue. A synchronization primitive.

-- Using 'wait' on an unset semaphore blocks.
-- Using 'signal' on a set semaphore blocks.
-- All other operations do not block.

-- Using 'wait' on a semaphore makes it unset once the wait resolves.
-- Using 'signal' on a semaphore makes it set once the signal resolves.
