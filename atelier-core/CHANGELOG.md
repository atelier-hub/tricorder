# Changelog

All notable changes to `atelier-core` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- `Atelier.Effects.File` now re-exports `IOMode (..)`.
- `Atelier.Effects.Process`: `withProcessGroup` runs a process in its own
  process group and guarantees the whole group is torn down when the body
  returns or throws; `terminateProcessGroup` aborts a running group from
  another thread (for children that trap `SIGINT`, where interrupting the
  group is not enough).
- New module `Atelier.Effects.Process.Internal`, exposing the `RunningProcess`
  constructor for tests that fabricate a handle. Production code should not
  import it.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Atelier.Effects.Process.RunningProcess` is now a distinct
  `newtype` wrapping `System.Process.Typed.Process` (previously a type
  synonym). `getStdin`/`getStdout`/`getStderr` operate on the new type.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `Atelier.Effects.Process` no longer exports `setCreateGroup`,
  `startProcess`, or `stopProcess`. Process lifecycle is now managed through
  `withProcessGroup`.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Initial release: foundational Effectful-based effects and utilities,
  extracted from the atelier toolkit.
