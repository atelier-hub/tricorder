-- | Focused stress tests for 'Conc.scoped' teardown.
--
-- The full test suite occasionally deadlocks under heavy scheduler pressure
-- (CPU oversubscription). Earlier A/B experiments ruled out the channel
-- primitive: converting the Iterator/Publishing path from unagi to STM did not
-- change the hang rate, which points at the one layer common to every victim —
-- Ki structured-concurrency teardown in the 'Conc' effect ('runConc' /
-- 'Conc.scoped' killing and awaiting forked threads at scope close).
--
-- These tests hammer that teardown in a tight loop so a low-probability
-- lost-wakeup becomes near-certain under load, isolating it from Pub/Sub,
-- Iterator, channels, and everything else. Iteration count is tunable via
-- @ATELIER_CONC_STRESS_N@ (crank it up under @yes@-load to reproduce). Each
-- test is wrapped in a 'timeout' so a real teardown hang fails loudly instead
-- of wedging the run.
